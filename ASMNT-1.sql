/*Assignment 1: You have received the below mail from your CEO and you have to respond to that 
mail. 
Hi,
Our portal is live and itâ€™s been quite some time now. Could you please help me in understanding 
from where the bulk of our website sessions are coming from?
I want to see specifically breakdown of UTM source, campaign and referring domain. 
Cheers!
From CEO,
